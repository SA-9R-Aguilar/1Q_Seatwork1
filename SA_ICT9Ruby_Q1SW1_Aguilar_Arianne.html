<h1><em>&#9734;2000s chick flick movie girlbosses&#9734;</em></h1>

<br>

<h2>&#10023;What is chick flick?</h2>
	<p>It is a movie genre marketed towards women. It usually follows the story of a female lead or main character working towards a goal, dealing with a problem, or dealing with a love interest.</p>

<br>

<h2>&#10023;Why I love films under this genre:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I always get second-hand embarrassment during the cheesy scenes AND I LOVE IT</li>
	<li>The rollercoaster of emotions when the female lead finally achieves whatever her goals are</li>
	<li>The hair, the outfits, and the fashion sense is iconic</li>
	<li>Most, if not all, female leads can be great rolemodels</li>
	<li>These movies usually promote women empowerment and how girls should stick together
	instead of competing</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>&#x1F48C;My favorite characters!</h2>

Elle Woods from <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/legally_blonde" target="_blank">Legally Blonde</a> is one of my rolemodels. She worked hard, studied hard, and built valuable connections which helped her to achieve 
her dream of becoming a lawyer and proved everyone, who underestimated her, wrong. And she did it all in pink!

Cher Horowitz from <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clueless" target="_blank">Clueless</a> is a fashion icon. Her hair is stunning and her outfits throughout the movie are amazing! She's the typical popular girl, 
however, she isn't mean at all. She was self-absorbed at the beginning of the film, but she soon starts to help others, rekindle her friendships, and use 
her popularity and influence to lead a donation drive.

Kat Stratford from <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10_things_i_hate_about_you" target="_blank">10 Things I Hate About You</a> is another feminist girlboss. I love that her character has duality. She's blunt and people think she's cold 
but she can be kind, caring, and loving when someone makes the effort to know her. She is independent and doesn't care what others think of her, which, 
to me, is admirable.
